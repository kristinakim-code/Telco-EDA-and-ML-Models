# Project Title: 
# Telco Data EDA and Machine Learning Models for Churn Data 
# Project Objective:
# In this project, I perform Explanatory Data Analysis or EDA on Customer Churn data within the Telecommuunication industry and build various machine learning models to predict whether or not a customer will churn.
# Project Process:
# I use libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, and MatPlotLib for the EDA to see which variables are most correlated with the Churn variable. 
# I create a SweetViz and Pandas Profiling Report to further investigate Churn variable.
# Then, I use four different models (Naive-Bayes, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and Random Forest) to predict whether or not a customer is likely to turn.
# Lastly, I tune the model using different parameters to get the models as accurate as possible.
# Project Challenges and Future Improvements:
# Dataset is biased towards non-churned customers, so it has to be standardized.
# The models always have room for improvement, so I would continue tuning the models using other parameters and try using other models as well. 
# Lastly, it was difficult working with all the different libraries since some required others to be later or earlier versions, and they wouldn't always overlap.
# How to Run:
# Download attached CSV file and run the Jupyter Notebook. Ensure that you change the second cell (reading the file) to the directory in your personal device.
